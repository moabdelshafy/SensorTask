# Sensors Task
We have different IOT sensors (Temperature Sensor, Humidity Sensor, light sensor) For an environment. 
Environment is the place where sensors read the current value and alarm if any abnormal case. 
Environment has the Temperature, Humidity, Light details. 
Sensors may be active or inactive (inactive sensors will not work, neither read data nor affect abnormality state of the location). 
The user can configure and interact with the sensors. Also, user can adjust the environment values and set number of locations. 
Every location in the environment will have one sensor of every type.
